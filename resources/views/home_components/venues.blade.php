Situated in Sydney’s Double Bay, at its core, Margaret is a celebration of the deep relationships Neil Perry has built over decades with Australia’s most dedicated farmers and fishermen. The restaurant is driven by these trusted partnerships, resulting in an offering that showcases not only world-class wild-caught seafood, but also one of the most respected and carefully curated meat programs in the country.


A focus on Australia’s extraordinary seafood remains central to Neil’s cuisine, proudly featured throughout the menu alongside premium cuts of beef sourced through a network of producers committed to ethical, sustainable practices.


With dishes that change daily depending on the finest seasonal ingredients available to us, Margaret is a dynamic expression of produce, craft, and care - where the best ingredients, wines, and service come together in a truly memorable dining experience.


Margaret is named after Neil Perry’s late mother who was the matriarch of the family, the nurturer and carer, and the one who held everyone together. These wonderful qualities became the inspiration behind the CARE philosophy that Neil created; caring for our suppliers, each other, the community and environment, which he has applied throughout his entire career as a chef and restaurateur.
